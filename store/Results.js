      "Izuku is a very timid, reserved, and polite boy, frequently overreacting to abnormal situations with exaggerated expressions. Due to    years of being looked down on by Katsuki for lacking a Quirk, he is initially portrayed as insecure, tearful, vulnerable, and non-expressive",
    finishing:
      "Delaware Detroit Smash is one of the strongest Super Moves in Izuku's arsenal. He uses both his 100% Delaware Smash and his 100 Detroit Smash at the same time, multiplying their destructive power into one attack."

      "Bakugo is a crude, arrogant, short-tempered, and aggressive person, especially at the beginning of the series. Bakugo tends to come off as unheroic. This problematic behavior goes all the way back to his early childhood days when he was known to bully a young, Quirkless, Izuku Midoriya.",
    finishing:
      "Bakugo's Finishing Move: Once he's high enough, he aims himself at his target and then uses more explosions to spin while propelling himself towards it at incredible speed. The speed at which he spins gathers the resulting smoke from his explosions and forms a miniature tornado around"
