# Tyler Capstick's **CAPSTONE**

 ## [My Capstone](https://github.com/Tcap92/Capstone)

 ## Outline:

1. **_What do I want the functionality of each page to be?_** I want the homepage to have the
navigation bar at the top, underneath that I would like to have my character quiz which will
have X questions. As the user answers one question another will pop up for them to answer.
When they are finished with the quiz they will press a submit button and it will give them the
character related to the answers they provided. My facts pages I want to have some random
generated anime facts with also specific anime facts based on what you want to view. My
about us will be a short story of how I decided to make the website. Finally my contact us
button will show the users an email address associated with the website in case they have
feedback.
2. **_What is the purpose of my application?_** The purpose of my application is for fun, I have done
many of these personality/character quizzes and they ‘can’ be super enjoyable.
3. **_What business problem or real world problem am I going to be solving?_** A Lot of these
character quizzes are pretty bad, people can answer completely different answers and receive
the same Character as another. I hope to create my application far superior to these other
websites.

## About me:
Hello! My name is Tyler Capstick. I have a background in the service and glasswork industries. I started working when I was 17 at a local pizza delivery company. After I graduated highschool I attended SCC and got my associates degree. I could not figure out what to major in so decided to follow in the footsteps of my friends who were all going the business route. I had plans of attending a university but life happened so it unfortunately had to be delayed. Looking back on that now, that possibly could have been a positive because I was not too excited about the business world. I have had a passion for technology ever since I was a child, and a friend of mine told me about coding bootcamps. Instantly I was intrigued, and I decided to attend the **_Savvy Coders_** preview night and I knew right away this was the career path that was meant for me.

I am a very nerdy/geeky individual, so for my capstone project, I decided to create an anime personality website that allows my fellow anime enthusiasts to find out what anime character they are most alike. This website allows users to answer a variety of questions from what time period they would enjoy the most to how they would act in certain situations to determine which characteristics they have most related to a specific anime character. Many other personality tests I have viewed/taken had super generic questions and 9/10 me and my friends got the same character with completely different answers. I want to build a creative and innovative website that allows fans of shows to truly be excited while taking my test.
