      -------Hello! My name is Tyler Capstick. I have a background in the service and glasswork industries. I started working when I was 17 at a local pizza delivery company. After I graduated highschool I attended SCC and got my associates degree. I could not figure out what to major in so decided to follow in the footsteps of my friends who were all going the business route. I had plans of attending a university but life happened so it unfortunately had to be delayed. Looking back on that now, that possibly could have been a positive because I was not too excited about the business world. I have had a passion for technology ever since I was a child, and a friend of mine told me about coding bootcamps. Instantly I was intrigued, and I decided to attend the Savvy Coders preview night and I knew right away this was the career path that was meant for me.

      I am a very nerdy/geeky individual, so for my capstone project, I decided to create an anime personality website that allows my fellow anime enthusiasts to find out what anime character they are most alike. This website allows users to answer a variety of questions from what time period they would enjoy the most to how they would act in certain situations to determine which characteristics they have most related to a specific anime character. Many other personality tests I have viewed/taken had super generic questions and 9/10 me and my friends got the same character with completely different answers. I want to build a creative and innovative website that allows fans of shows to truly be excited while taking my test.

    <h3> I am an aspiring JR Full-Stack developer. I am currently attending Savvy Coders. I have loved technology ever since I was a child and I am looking forward to developing websites and apps. After graduating highschool I didn't know exactly which degree I wanted to pursue so I ended up pursuing the same type of degree my friends were going towards. During Covid I decided to switch up my career path towards something I have always loved which is technology </h3>
